# Kortana Chatbot Interface
This repository contains a simple interface for an AI chatbot, built with Vite and JavaScript. The chatbot utilizes the OpenAI API to provide text-based conversation with users.

## Demo
We've deployed the chatbot to a live server so you can try it out for yourself! Check it out here.
> https://kortana.vercel.app/

The demo site allows you to chat with the bot in real-time, just like you would in a messaging app. Type in a message and hit enter to see the bot's response. You can also scroll up and down to see your chat history.

Please note that the demo site is hosted on a shared server and may experience occasional downtime or slow response times due to high traffic. If you encounter any issues, please try again later or contact us for assistance.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-chatbot-interface.git`
Install dependencies:
`npm install`
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API key:
`OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here`

## Usage
Start the development server:
`npm start`
Visit http://localhost:5000 in your web browser to view the chatbot interface.

To use the chatbot, enter a message in the input field and press enter or click the submit button. The chatbot will respond with a message generated by the OpenAI API.
